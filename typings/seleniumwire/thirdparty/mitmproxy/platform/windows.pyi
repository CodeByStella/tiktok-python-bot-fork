class TransparentProxy:
    """
    Transparent Windows Proxy for mitmproxy based on WinDivert/PyDivert. This module can be used to
    redirect both traffic that is forwarded by the host and traffic originating from the host itself.

    Requires elevated (admin) privileges. Can be started separately by manually running the file.

    How it works:

    (1) First, we intercept all packages that match our filter.
    We both consider traffic that is forwarded by the OS (WinDivert's NETWORK_FORWARD layer) as well
    as traffic sent from the local machine (WinDivert's NETWORK layer). In the case of traffic from
    the local machine, we need to exempt packets sent from the mitmproxy to not create a redirect loop.
    To accomplish this, we use Windows' GetExtendedTcpTable syscall and determine the source
    application's PID.

    For each intercepted package, we
        1. Store the source -> destination mapping (address and port)
        2. Remove the package from the network (by not reinjecting it).
        3. Re-inject the package into the local network stack, but with the destination address
           changed to the mitmproxy.

    (2) Next, the mitmproxy receives the forwarded packet, but does not know the real destination yet
    (which we overwrote with the mitmproxy's address). On Linux, we would now call
    getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST). We now access the redirect module's API (see APIRequestHandler),
    submit the source information and get the actual destination back (which we stored in 1.1).

    (3) The mitmproxy now establishes the upstream connection as usual.

    (4) Finally, the mitmproxy sends the response back to the client. To make it work, we need to change
    the packet's source address back to the original destination (using the mapping from 1.1),
    to which the client believes it is talking to.

    Limitations:

    - We assume that ephemeral TCP ports are not re-used for multiple connections at the same time.
    The mitmproxy will fail if an application connects to example.com and example.org from
    192.168.0.42:4242 simultaneously. This could be mitigated by introducing unique "meta-addresses"
    which mitmproxy sees, but this would remove the correct client info from mitmproxy.
